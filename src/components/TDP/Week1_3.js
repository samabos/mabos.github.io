				<h4>Initial Post</h4>
				<p>
					Data scientists will inevitably morph into new specialized roles. Due to the growth in data volume and processing power over the past five years, the data scientist role has flourished. The number of job postings for data scientists alone increased by 1,287% in 2017 (Royal Society, 2019). Even though this portends a promising future for data scientists, it is important to note that the discipline is moving toward quantum data science, which will call for a change in roles.
					<br />
					As of right now, E. Services (2015: 20) describe data scientists' functions and duties as:<br />
					<ol>
						<li>Reframe business challenges as analytics challenges.</li>
						<li>Design, implement, and deploy statistical models and data mining techniques on Bigdata.</li>
						<li>Develop insights that lead to actionable recommendations.</li>
					</ol>
					New AI systems being developed by IT companies may enable the deployment of statistical models in a no-code setting. The creation of websites is a typical illustration. In the past, web developers had to do a lot of coding work, but nowadays several no-code technologies aid in website development.

					Similar to how the position of computer scientist has evolved into that of software engineer, system and network administrator, business analyst, etc. Software engineers eventually transition to frontend, backend, and full-stack development roles. Quantum data scientists, AI engineers, data architects, and Bigdata engineers will take the place of data scientists and engineers.

				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
				<p>
					Contrary to popular belief, I am more confident in the data scientist discipline's future after carefully evaluating my colleagues' work and perspectives. In his article, Saxena (2021) stated that there will be fewer data scientist job opportunities in the next five years. While this may be true, the reason could be that data scientists morph into other disciplines, contrary to the belief that automation will reduce data scientist job opportunities. In response to Victoria Stapleton's initial post, Olubiyi Akintade wrote about how machines are designed to make our jobs easier rather than to replace us. This phrase summarizes the need to dispel the myth that automation would eliminate the role of a data scientist. Rather, it may evolve into more specialized fields. Furthermore, as data volume and computer power grow, so will the prospects for a data scientist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Continuous learning is essential to keep up in the field of data science, and this is not limited to the data science discipline alone; there are other disciplines that require as much learning effort to keep up with the trends of technological advancements, such as software engineering. In his article, Yıldırım (2020) stated the need to acquire several skills in some domains, such as mathematics, statistics, machine learning, software programming, soft skills, business domain knowledge, and data science ethics to be a data scientist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Data ethics in data science is an issue that is rarely discussed; data scientists of the future must take data ownership and responsibility for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data while carrying out their job functions. A proper master data management approach will go a long way toward assisting data scientists in demonstrating professional ethics when dealing with personal data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without a doubt, the path ahead for a data scientist will be tough, and keeping up with the current technological advances will make it even more challenging, but the future is bright and full of numerous prospects.

					<h3>Artefacts</h3>
				</header>
				<h4>Initial Post</h4>
				<p>
						The world is changing rapidly, and the advancement of technology adoption forces data protection regulators to race to keep up by implementing necessary controls and regulatory instruments. It's better to act now than never. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR is a data protection and privacy regulation in EU law that applies to the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also covers the transfer of personal data outside of the EU and EEA (EU Commission, 2019).
						</p>
					<p>	Data protection is being taken more seriously than ever before, affecting a wide range of stakeholders and industries. The GDPR protects both businesses and individuals. Businesses should be aware of the process and guidelines for collecting and processing personal data, likewise, individuals should also be aware of their data-related rights.
					</p>
					<p>	The GDPR Regulation by the European Union (2016).  Article 4  "personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person". Also, Article 5 (a) "Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (lawfulness, fairness and transparency)".
				</p>
						<p>
						The Google Android Advertising ID (AAID) is a special code used to track user behaviour by Google, app developers, and a wide range of other parties involved in the advertising ecosystem. Recently, complaints have been filed against Google as a data controller for using AAID in violation of GDPR laws, one of which is Noyb's formal GDPR complaint against Google for using an Android Advertising ID to track users without legitimate justification (Noyb, 2020). The AAID is still being used by Google and the platform app developers without giving the users the choice to opt-out. IOS platform users now have the power to turn off this advertisement tracking, despite Apple previously being in the same situation as Google, Apple changed how the tacking ID was implemented and gave the user more control.

					</p>



				<h4>Summary Post</h4>
					<p>During this group discussion, my colleagues raised some critical points about how master data management can aid in EU GDPR compliance. The importance of having a strict data policy in place that addresses how an organisation will collect, manage, and transfer the data it collects on behalf of its internal and external customers cannot be overemphasized. Without master data management, organisations will have personal data in silos across departments and systems, making GDPR compliance difficult to achieve.
</p>
					<p>The GDPR gives individuals more control over their personal data and how it is collected and used, with the goal of protecting individuals' data privacy within the European Union (EU Commission, 2019). GDPR should be viewed by organizations and businesses as an opportunity to strengthen their data governance. This, in turn, will demonstrate to prospective clients that the organization is serious about data security. According to a 2019 study conducted by Momen, Hatamian, and Fritsch, app privacy has improved moderately since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation. While this is true for many organizations, some organizations find it difficult to fully implement GDPR laws, particularly those pertaining to the subject of consent.
</p>
					<p>Article 7 and further specified in GDPR recital 42. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment (European Union, 2016). Because the user can never disable or opt-out of this feature, the Google Android Advertising ID gives the user the option of tracking or more tracking (Noyb, 2020). Android app developers will be able to monetize advertisements by targeting the user interest collected by using this tracking ID if the mobile device is in use. The fact that Apple allows users of its mobile devices to opt-out of targeted ads weakens Google's position.
</p>
					<p>
Although the EU GDPR is still in its infancy, several lessons have been learned in its three years of implementation. The law will be revised in the future and getting GDPR enforcement right is critical for ensuring the right to data protection.

						<p>Participating in this fruitful discussion about the future of data scientists with my colleagues has broadened my knowledge of the critical roles and responsibilities of a data scientist, as well as the ethics and expectations of the profession.
							To be a successful data scientist, you must have soft skills, statistical skills, mathematical skills, coding skills, and an understanding of the business domain.</p>

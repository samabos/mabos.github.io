				<h3>Downloading Rstudio and Using R</h3>
				<p>Working with R in Rstudio has been truly amazing; even as a programmer, I had no idea what R programming language was used for; the simplicity is amazing, and the fact that it will do most of the work with 
                a single line of code and present statistical results, plot a chart, or table is simply amazing.</p>
